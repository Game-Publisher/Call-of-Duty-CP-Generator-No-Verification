Purchase discounted gift cards for platforms like Google Play, PlayStation, or Xbox.
Focus on grinding the game’s free content and challenges.
9. What Can You Do to Avoid Scams?
Only purchase CP from official platforms, such as the in-game store or authorized sellers.
Be wary of websites or services that promise "too good to be true" deals.
